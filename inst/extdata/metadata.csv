"DNA methylation data of CLL primary samples","The data was produced with the use of 450k and 850k methylation arrays. Preprocessing of raw IDAT files was made using minfi R/Bioconductor package version 1.19.16. Intensities were normalized using the functional normalization algorithm. CpG sites containing SNPs inside the probe body were removed. Data is a subset of CpG sites presentin 450k methylation arrays.","3.7","hg19","IDAT","https://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/ega/datasets/EGAD00010000948","2018-01-27","Homo sapiens",9606,FALSE,"European Molecular Biology Laboratory","Andreas Mock <andreas.mock@embl.de>, Malgorzata Oles <malgorzata.oles@embl.de>","RangedSummarizedExperiment","Rda","CLLmethylation/meth.Rda"
